Taking a look at what employers look for in candidates
From a data frame with different data on candidates seeking employment, the analysis was seeking to determine the different characterisitics in the candidates that have led to a greater employment by recruiters.
There were various specializations that were seemed to be of more interest to recruiters such as Marketing with HR and Marketing with Finance which is consistent with the current information age that seeks to capitalize on the use of data to market products.
The study does not take into account other situational factors such as networking abilities and hard work in the workplace. It does however offer significant insight into areas to target if one is looking to take on an educational pursuit in the hope of employment.
